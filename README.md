1. This is a daily React practice project
2. This project is supposed to teach the concepts of native and custom hooks, state management, routing, redux, testing and some other stuff in React with Typescript
3. The idea is to do one big project to revise React

SCHEDULE

Revised Plan — 7 Weeks, One Evolving Project (TypeScript-first)
Week 0 — Habit + Safe Entry (TS from Day 1)

Objective: Show up daily without fear.

You will do

Vite + React + TypeScript

Basic components (.tsx)

First Jest + RTL tests

Concepts

JSX + TSX basics

Function components

Props (inferred)

Minimal typing (no interfaces unless needed)

Rule

If TS complains, simplify, don’t fight it.

Week 1 — Core React + Router Basics

Objective: Navigation without anxiety.

Concepts

useState

props

conditional rendering

React Router

BrowserRouter

Routes, Route

simple layout routes

Project work

Home / Dashboard pages

Static navigation (no guards yet)

Tests

Route renders correct page

Component renders inside router

Week 2 — Effects + Data Flow

Objective: Make async predictable.

Concepts

useEffect

dependency arrays

cleanup

derived vs stored state

Project work

Fake API calls

Loading / error states per route

Tests

async rendering

loading → success

Week 3 — App-wide State (Context)

Objective: Understand why global state exists.

Concepts

useContext

Provider patterns

memoization boundaries

Project work

Auth state (mock)

User roles (admin/user)

Tests

Provider + consumer tests

Role-based rendering

Week 4 — Router Guards + Reducers

Objective: Structure without overengineering.

Concepts

Protected routes

useReducer

action-driven updates

Project work

Role-based access control

Redirect logic

Tests

Guard logic

Reducer unit tests

Week 5 — Redux Toolkit (Selective, Not Global)

Objective: Use Redux where it earns its keep.

Concepts

configureStore

createSlice

createAsyncThunk

Redux vs Context boundaries

Project work

Migrate ONE domain (e.g. dashboard data)

Keep auth in Context

Tests

slice tests

thunk tests (happy path only)

Week 6 — TypeScript Deepening + Performance

Objective: Let TS work for you.

Concepts

typing reducers & thunks

discriminated unions

useMemo, useCallback

custom hooks

Project work

Extract hooks

Reduce unnecessary renders

Tests

hook tests

regression tests

Week 7 — Integration & Confidence

Objective: Feel solid, not “done”.

You will do

End-to-end flow

Clean up types

Improve test coverage

Write clear README

Outcome

“I can design, build, and reason about a React + TS app.”

Non-negotiable operating rules (ADHD-specific)

15–45 min sessions

One task per day

Stop while okay

No tutorial during coding

Ugly > incomplete > perfect
